# Script structure

A Pine script follows this general structure:

```pine
<version>
<declaration_statement>
<code>
```

## Version

A
[compiler annotation](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/script-structure/#compiler-annotations) in the following form tells the compiler which of the
versions of Pine Script® the script is written in:

```pine
//@version=6
```

- The version number is a number from 1 to 6.
- The compiler annotation is not mandatory. When omitted, version 1 is
  assumed. It is strongly recommended to always use the latest version
  of the language.
- While it is synctactically correct to place the version compiler
  annotation anywhere in the script, it is much more useful to readers
  when it appears at the top of the script.

Notable changes to the current version of Pine Script are documented in
the [Release notes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/release-notes/).

## Declaration statement

All Pine scripts must contain one declaration statement, which is a call
to one of these functions:

- [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
- [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
- [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library)

The declaration statement:

- Identifies the type of the script, which in turn dictates which
  content is allowed in it, and how it can be used and executed.
- Sets key properties of the script such as its name, where it will
  appear when it is added to a chart, the precision and format of the
  values it displays, and certain values that govern its runtime
  behavior, such as the maximum number of drawing objects it will
  display on the chart. With strategies, the properties include
  parameters that control backtesting, such as initial capital,
  commission, slippage, etc.

Each script type has distinct basic requirements. Scripts that do not meet these criteria cause a compilation error:

- Indicators must call at least one function that creates a script output, such as [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot), [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape), [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor), [line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new), [log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info), [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert), etc.
- [Strategies](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/) must call at least one [order placement command](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/#order-placement-and-cancellation) or other output function.
- [Libraries](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/libraries/) must [export](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_export) at least one user-defined [function](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/), [method](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/methods/#user-defined-methods), [type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#user-defined-types), or [enum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/enums/).

## Code

Lines in a script that are not
[comments](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/script-structure/#comments)
or
[compiler annotations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/script-structure/#compiler-annotations) are *statements*, which implement the script’s algorithm. A
statement can be one of these:

- [variable declaration](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/)
- [variable reassignment](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#variable-reassignment)
- [function definition](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/#structure-and-syntax)
- [built-in function call](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/built-ins/#built-in-functions),
  [user-defined function call](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/) or
  [a library function call](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/libraries/#using-a-library)
- [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if),
  [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for),
  [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while),
  [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch),
  [type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_type), or
  [enum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_enum)
  *structure*.

Statements can be arranged in multiple ways:

- Some statements can be expressed in one line, like most variable
  declarations, lines containing only a function call or single-line
  function declarations. Lines can also be
  [wrapped](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/script-structure/#line-wrapping) (continued on multiple lines). Multiple one-line
  statements can be concatenated on a single line by using the comma
  as a separator.
- Others statements such as structures or multiline function
  definitions always require multiple lines because they require a
  *local block*. A local block must be indented by a tab or four
  spaces. Each local block defines a distinct *local scope*.
- Statements in the *global scope* of the script (i.e., which are not
  part of local blocks) cannot begin with white space (a space or a
  tab). Their first character must also be the line’s first
  character. Lines beginning in a line’s first position become by
  definition part of the script’s *global scope*.

A simple valid Pine Script indicator can be generated in the Pine
Script Editor by using the “Open” button and choosing “New blank
indicator”:

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("My Script")
plot(close)
```

This indicator includes three local blocks, one in the `barIsUp()` function
declaration, and two in the variable declaration using an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure:

```pine
//@version=6

indicator("", "", true)    // Declaration statement (global scope)

barIsUp() =>    // Function declaration (global scope)
    close > open    // Local block (local scope)

plotColor = if barIsUp()  // Variable declaration (global scope)
    color.green     // Local block (local scope)
else
    color.red       // Local block (local scope)

bgcolor(color.new(plotColor, 70))   // Call to a built-in function  (global scope)
```

You can bring up a simple Pine Script strategy by selecting “New
blank strategy” instead:

```pine
//@version=6
strategy("My Strategy", overlay=true, margin_long=100, margin_short=100)

longCondition = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (longCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long)

shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (shortCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Short Entry Id", strategy.short)
```

## Comments

Double slashes (`//`) define comments in Pine Script. Comments can
begin anywhere on the line. They can also follow Pine Script code on
the same line:

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("")
// This line is a comment
a = close // This is also a comment
plot(a)
```

The Pine Editor has a keyboard shortcut to comment/uncomment lines:
`ctrl` + `/`. You can use it on multiple lines by highlighting them
first.

## Line wrapping

Scripts can use *line wrapping* to define a long *single line* of code across *multiple* lines. Generally, each wrapped line after the first can use any indentation length *except* multiples of four, because Pine uses four-space or tab indentations to define [local code blocks](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/programming/#what-does-scope-mean).

For example, consider the following line of code:

```pine
float x = open + high + low + close
```

We can distribute any part of this single line of code across two or more lines. Within a wrapped statement or expression, the subsequent lines can use different indentation lengths, and can also include [comments](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/script-structure/#comments) without disrupting the code:

```pine
float x = open +
  high +           // Indented by 2 spaces.
     low +         // Indented by 5 spaces.
          close    // Indented by 10 spaces.
```

If parts of a wrapped expression are enclosed in *parentheses* `( )`, such as function calls or parameter declarations, the wrapped lines within the parentheses *do not* have any restriction on their indentation lengths. Therefore, those wrapped lines can use any indentation length *including* multiples of four.

For example, this script demonstrates various ways that expressions enclosed in parentheses can wrap across multiple lines:

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Line wrapping within parentheses demo")

// We can enclose operations in parentheses to wrap them across multiple lines using a four-space indentation.
float x = (open +
    high +
    low +
    close)

// We can wrap a long function call across two lines, for a minimal line wrapping style.
plot(ta.sma(close, 14), title = "Avg close", color = color.new(color.purple, 70), style = plot.style_area,
 force_overlay = true, display = display.all - display.status_line)     // Indented by one space.

// We can also wrap a long function call across multiple lines, each with different indentation lengths.
// The parentheses enclosing the wrapped lines can start and end on separate lines than the wrapped content.
plot(
 series = x, title = "Sum OHLC",                              // Indented by one space.
   color = (x >= x[1] ? color.green : color.red),             // Indented by three spaces.
    linewidth = 4,                                            // Indented by four spaces.
        style = plot.style_stepline                           // Indented by eight spaces.
)                                                             // No indentation.
```

Expressions inside *local* code blocks can also use line wrapping. A local block requires indenting each line that belongs to its scope by four spaces or a tab relative to the local block’s header. Therefore, we recommend indenting any wrapped lines inside local blocks by a *larger* indentation than that of the block’s scope for readability. For example:

```pine
upDown(float s) =>
    // These lines are indented by four spaces relative to the `upDown()` function header to belong to its local scope.
    var int ud = 0
    bool isEqual   = s == s[1]
    bool isGrowing = s > s[1]
    // Within the local block, this statement wraps across multiple lines, where each line uses
    // an indentation length that is larger than the indentation that signifies the local block's scope.
    ud := isEqual ?
           0 :
           isGrowing ?
               (ud <= 0 ?
                    1 :
                    ud + 1) :
               (ud >= 0 ?
                    -1 :
                    ud - 1)
```

Scripts can also create line-wrapped expressions by using [multiline strings](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strings/#multiline-strings). A multiline string, enclosed by three pairs of quotation marks (e.g., `"""..."""`) or apostrophes (e.g., `'''...'''`), can occupy multiple lines in the Pine Editor, where each part of the code between the `"""` or `'''` delimiters represents *literal text*. If an expression uses a string spanning multiple lines as an operand or argument, Pine still treats that expression as part of a *single* line of code. For example:

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("Line wrapping with multiline strings demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A string indicating whether the bar is rising, falling, or neutral.
//          The strings in the ternary operations span multiple visible lines, but the entire expression is
//          considered part of a single line.
string labelText = close > open ? """
Bar is rising.
""" : close < open ? """
Bar is falling.
""" : """
Bar is neutral.
"""

// Draw a label to display the text from the current `labelText` string.
label.new(bar_index, close, labelText)
```

Note that:

- A multiline string treats *all* characters between the `"""` or `'''` delimiters as literal text, including the *leading spaces* on each visible code line. If a line in a multiline string definition is indented by any number of spaces, relative to *column 0* in the Pine Editor, the line in the resulting string also includes that indentation.

## Compiler annotations

Compiler annotations are
[comments](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/script-structure/#comments)
that issue special instructions for a script:

- `//@version=` specifies the PineScript version that the compiler
  will use. The number in this annotation should not be confused with
  the script’s version number, which updates on every saved change
  to the code.
- `//@description` sets a custom description for scripts that use the
  [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library)
  declaration statement.
- `//@function`, `//@param` and `//@returns` add custom descriptions
  for a [user-defined function](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/user-defined-functions/) or [method](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/methods/), its parameters, and its result when placed above the function declaration.
- `//@type` adds a custom description for a [user-defined type (UDT)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#user-defined-types) when placed
  above the type declaration.
- `//@enum` adds a custom description for an [enum types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#enum-types) when placed above the enum declaration.
- `//@field` adds a custom description for the field of a [user-defined type (UDT)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#user-defined-types) or an [enum types](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#enum-types) when placed above the type or enum declaration.
- `//@variable` adds a custom description for a variable when placed
  above its declaration.
- `//@strategy_alert_message` provides a default message for strategy
  scripts to pre-fill the “Message” field in the alert creation
  dialog.

The Pine Editor also features two specialized annotations, `//#region` and `//#endregion`, that create *collapsible* code regions.
Clicking the dropdown arrow next to a `//#region` line collapses all the code between that line and the nearest `//#endregion` annotation
below it.

This example draws a triangle using three interactively selected points on the chart.
The script illustrates how one can use compiler and Editor annotations to document code and make it easier to navigate:

```pine

    line.new(t.time2, t.price2, t.time3, t.price3, xloc = xloc.bar_time, color = t.lineColor)
    line.new(t.time1, t.price1, t.time3, t.price3, xloc = xloc.bar_time, color = t.lineColor)
